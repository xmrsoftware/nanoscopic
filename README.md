## About Nanoscopic

The Nanoscopic blogging platform is designed to allow multiple users to run multiple blogs at the same time.
Furthermore, it aims for the fastest possible page load times in order to make the browsing experience as pleasant as
possible for visitors to your blog(s).

## Nanoscopic Licence

The Nanoscopic project is released under the Apache 2.0 License. Please see the LICENSE file for details.

## System Requirements

Currently, due to a lack of resources Nanoscopic Blog is only tested on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. If you would like to help
the project then testing it and making sure it works on other Linux distributions would be a great thing to do.

* PostgreSQL 13.3 or greater
* Node.js 16.1.0 or greater
* npm 7.11.2 or greater

Nanoscopic might work with older versions of the software. These are the versions that Nanoscopic was developed
against. If you would like to help out then testing Nanoscopic on older versions of the software requirements and
reporting your findings would be highly appreciated.

## Browser Support

Since Nanoscopic is a brand-new project that is aiming to be supported for years to come it seems silly to support
legacy browsers from the beginning. Therefore, Nanoscopic supports the latest version of all the main browsers
(Firefox, Chrome, Chromium Edge, Safari) and also the following mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Android
Firefox).

If you would like to help the project support more browsers than that it would be greatly appreciated. Fixes for other
browsers will be accepted.

## Selenium Tests

If you wish to run the Selenium unit tests you will need Python 3.8 or greater, pip, and the Selenium framework
installed along with the proper WebDrivers installed on your path. The Selenium unit tests are held in a different
repository on GitHub.
